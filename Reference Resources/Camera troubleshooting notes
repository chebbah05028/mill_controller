Upon being hooked up the camera starts as normal, presenting the following warnings:
[ WARN] [1544491904.906006618]: white_balance_temperature_auto: Input/output error
VIDIOC_S_CTRL: failed: Input/output error

[ WARN] [1544491904.917183967]: unknown control 'focus_auto'

In one instance it presented only the last of those, was restarted, presented all of them, was restarted, and then presented as below


After being hit with ctrl-C and restarted, the start attempt failed with the following error:
[ERROR] [1544491921.640870105]: VIDIOC_S_FMT error 5, Input/output error



While we've been looking at focus_auto, its possible that this is a more advanced stage of the white_balance_temperature_auto warning

Further restarts return the same error
Disconnecting and reconnecting the camera resolves this issue, reproducing the three step sequence outlined above.

restarting roscore seems to have no effect
usb_cam default setting for autofocus should be off, but removing anything that sets it to be true doesn't seem to eliminate the warnings. I should try explicitly setting it to false.
Aamir says he noticed a similar issue, but Moshe says that he hasn't had to restart it with such reliability.
